# 🧪 Testing Guide: Automatic Business Rating System

## Quick Test Scenarios

### 📝 Test 1: AI Search Auto-Analysis
**Expected Behavior**: System automatically analyzes business potential when multiple parcels are found

**Steps**:
1. Open the app at `http://localhost:5176/`
2. Search for: `"restaurant locations near Caraga State University"`
3. **✅ Check**: Search results show multiple parcels
4. **✅ Check**: Loading indicator shows "Auto-analyzing..." briefly
5. Click on any parcel from search results
6. **✅ Verify**: Business rating loads automatically (no manual button click needed)
7. **✅ Verify**: Parcel shows proper ranking (NOT always Rank #1)
8. Click on different parcels from the same search
9. **✅ Verify**: Rankings are consistent and different (Rank #1, #2, #3, etc.)

### 📝 Test 2: Ranking Consistency
**Expected Behavior**: Individual parcel clicks maintain rankings from comparison analysis

**Steps**:
1. Perform AI search that returns 3+ parcels
2. Click "Compare Locations" button manually
3. **✅ Check**: Modal opens with multiple parcels ranked 1, 2, 3, etc.
4. Note the rankings in the modal
5. Close modal and click individual parcels
6. **✅ Verify**: Individual parcel ratings match the rankings from the modal
7. **✅ Verify**: No parcel shows "Rank #1" if it was ranked lower in comparison

### 📝 Test 3: Cache Performance
**Expected Behavior**: Subsequent clicks load instantly from cache

**Steps**:
1. Perform AI search and click several parcels
2. Open browser dev tools (F12) → Console tab
3. Click a parcel you've clicked before
4. **✅ Check Console**: Should see `🎯 Using comparison cache rating for parcel`
5. **✅ Verify**: Rating loads instantly (no loading delay)
6. Refresh the page and repeat
7. **✅ Check**: Cache persists across page refreshes

### 📝 Test 4: Auto-Loading vs Manual Loading
**Expected Behavior**: No need for manual "Refresh AI Business Rating" button

**Steps**:
1. Search for business locations
2. Click any parcel from search results
3. **✅ Verify**: Business rating section populates automatically
4. **✅ Verify**: No need to click "Refresh AI Business Rating" button
5. Click parcels that are NOT from search results (map parcels)
6. **✅ Verify**: These still auto-load but may show Rank #1 (correct for individual analysis)
