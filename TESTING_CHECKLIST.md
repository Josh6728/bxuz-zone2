- [ ] ✅ `✅ Using existing business rating data for modal`

## 🎯 Success Criteria

All checkboxes above should be ✅ **PASSED** for successful implementation.

## 🚨 If Issues Found

### Modal Still Auto-Pops Up:
- Check `handleSearchResults` function doesn't call `handleCompareLocations`
- Verify `handlePrepareBusinessRatings` doesn't set `setIsBusinessRatingModalOpen(true)`

### Button Doesn't Show Status:
- Verify `hasBusinessRatingData={businessRatingData !== null}` prop passed to SearchResults
- Check `isLoadingBusinessRating` state updates correctly

### Addresses Not Showing:
- Confirm BusinessRating interface includes `address: string`
- Verify business rating generation includes `address: parcel.address`

### Not Using Cached Data:
- Check `handleCompareLocations` compares parcel IDs correctly
- Verify cache manager `findParcelInComparisons` method works

## 🎉 Expected Final State

**Visual**: Search → Background Preparation → Ready Indicator → Instant Modal Display
**Performance**: First prep (3-10s) → Instant subsequent views (<100ms)
**UX**: Non-disruptive → User-controlled → Professional display

**READY FOR PRODUCTION!** 🚀
