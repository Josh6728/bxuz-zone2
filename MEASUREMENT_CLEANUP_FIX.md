# Fix for Blue Dots Remaining After Closing Measurement Panel

## Problem
When closing the measurement panel (clicking the X button), the blue dots (markers) and connecting lines remained visible on the map instead of being properly cleaned up.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the Google Maps measurement hook (`useGoogleMeasurement.ts`). The `clearMeasurement` function was trying to clean up markers by iterating over the `points` state, but since state updates are asynchronous, the points array would be cleared before the markers could be properly removed from the map.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Google Maps Cleanup
- **Added `markersRef`**: Created a ref to store markers independently of React state
- **Updated marker storage**: When creating markers, they're now stored in both the state (for rendering logic) and the ref (for cleanup)
- **Improved cleanup**: The `clearMeasurement` function now uses the ref to remove all markers before clearing the state

### 2. Enhanced Component Lifecycle Management
- **Added cleanup effects**: Added `useEffect` hooks in `MeasurementControls` to ensure cleanup happens when:
  - Component unmounts
  - `isActive` becomes false
- **Improved error handling**: Added try-catch blocks around Mapbox layer removal for safer cleanup

### 3. Key Changes Made

#### In `useGoogleMeasurement.ts`:
```typescript
// Added markers ref for persistent cleanup access
const markersRef = useRef<google.maps.Marker[]>([]);

// Store markers in ref when creating them
markersRef.current.push(marker);

// Use ref for cleanup instead of state
markersRef.current.forEach(marker => {
  marker.setMap(null);
});
markersRef.current = []; // Clear the array
```

#### In `MeasurementControls.tsx`:
```typescript
// Clean up when component unmounts or becomes inactive
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    if (isMeasuring) {
      clearMeasurement();
    }
  };
}, []);

// Clean up when isActive becomes false  
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isActive && isMeasuring) {
    clearMeasurement();
  }
}, [isActive, isMeasuring, clearMeasurement]);
```

## Expected Behavior Now
1. Click "Measure Distance" → Measurement mode activates
2. Click on map → Blue dots and lines appear
3. Click X button in measurement panel → **All blue dots and lines disappear immediately**
4. Map returns to normal state with regular cursor

## Testing
Test the fix by:
1. Starting a measurement
2. Placing several points (blue dots)
3. Clicking the X button in the measurement panel
4. Verify all visual elements are removed

The fix ensures proper cleanup for both Google Maps and Mapbox providers.
