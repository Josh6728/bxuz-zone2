# ✅ FIXED: Business Location Rankings Now Show Addresses

## 🎯 PROBLEM SOLVED
**Issue**: The Business Location Rankings modal was displaying generic IDs like "ai-parcel-1", "ai-parcel-4", "ai-parcel-0" instead of actual parcel addresses.

**Solution**: Updated the business rating system to include and display parcel addresses.

## 🔧 CHANGES MADE

### 1. Updated BusinessRating Interface (`types/zoning.ts`)
```typescript
export interface BusinessRating {
  parcelId: string;
  address: string;  // ✅ NEW: Added address field
  rating: number;
  explanation: string;
  factors: { ... };
  rank: number;
}
```

### 2. Updated Business Rating Generation (`services/business-rating.ts`)
```typescript
// Both main generation and fallback now include address
return {
  parcelId: parcel.id,
  address: parcel.address,  // ✅ NEW: Include parcel address
  rating: ...,
  explanation: ...,
  factors: { ... },
  rank: ...
};
```

### 3. Updated Business Rating Modal (`components/BusinessRatingModal.tsx`)
```typescript
// Changed from displaying parcelId to address
<span className="text-white font-medium">{rating.address}</span>
//                                      ^^^^^^^^^ NEW: Shows address instead of ID
```
