# Azure OpenAI Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ Current Status
Your Azure OpenAI integration is now working! The AI search functionality has been successfully implemented.

## üîß Configuration

### Development (Current Setup)
The AI search is currently configured for development with:
- `dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true` - Allows direct API calls from the browser
- `useBackendProxy: false` - Uses direct Azure OpenAI calls (no backend required)

This is the simplest setup for development and testing.

### Production Security (Recommended)

For production deployment, you should:

1. **Create a `.env` file** with these variables:
```env
# Azure OpenAI Service Configuration
VITE_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://castrodesjohnpaul-9316-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com/
VITE_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
VITE_AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-04-01-preview
VITE_AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=o4-mini
VITE_AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL=o4-mini

# AI Search Parameters
VITE_AZURE_OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=4096
VITE_AZURE_OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.7

# Production Security (recommended)
VITE_USE_BACKEND_PROXY=true
VITE_BACKEND_API_URL=https://your-backend.com/api/ai-search
```

2. **Create a backend API** to proxy OpenAI calls (keeps API key secure)
3. **Set `VITE_USE_BACKEND_PROXY=true`** to use the secure backend approach

## üöÄ Testing the AI Search

1. Open your app at http://localhost:5174/
2. Use the search bar at the top of the map
3. Try queries like:
   - "Find me a spot to build my Coffee Shop? Give me a specific parcel"
   - "Where can I build apartments in Butuan City?"
   - "Show me commercial zones near J.C. Aquino Avenue"
   - "What are the height restrictions in commercial areas?"
   - "Where can I build a small business in Butuan City?"

4. **New Features:**
   - üó∫Ô∏è **Map Markers**: Red pins will appear on suggested locations
   - üìç **Coordinates**: Exact coordinates are shown in search results
   - üéØ **Auto Zoom**: Map automatically centers on AI suggestions
   - üìã **Parcel Details**: Click red pins to see detailed parcel information

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Notes

- **Development**: Uses `dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true` for testing
- **Production**: Should use backend proxy to protect API keys
- **API Key**: Never commit real API keys to version control

## üìÅ Files Modified

- `src/config/azure-openai.ts` - Configuration settings
- `src/services/azure-openai.ts` - Azure OpenAI service implementation
- `src/utils/api.ts` - Updated to use real AI service
- `src/components/AISettings.tsx` - Connected to real configuration

## üîç AI Features

Your AI assistant is specialized for:
- Butuan City zoning regulations
- Philippine urban planning laws
- Development possibilities and restrictions
- Zoning code interpretations (R-1, C-1, MU, I-1, OS)
- Practical building and development advice
- **Location mapping with coordinates** - AI provides specific coordinates for suggested locations
- **Interactive map markers** - Click on red pins to see parcel details
- **Automatic map zoom** - Map centers on AI-suggested locations

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch" Error
If you see a backend API error:
1. Check that `useBackendProxy: false` in `src/config/azure-openai.ts`
2. Verify your Azure OpenAI credentials are correct
3. Look for console logs showing "Using direct Azure OpenAI connection"

### "400 Unsupported parameter" Error
If you see parameter errors like `max_completion_tokens`:
1. Updated API version to `2024-04-01-preview` (more stable)
2. Reduced `maxTokens` to `4096` (compatible with o4-mini)
3. Using deployment name instead of model name in API calls
4. Verify your Azure OpenAI deployment is using the correct model version

### Connection Test Fails
1. Go to Admin Portal ‚Üí AI Settings
2. Click "Test Connection"
3. Check if your endpoint and API key are correct
4. Verify your Azure OpenAI deployment is active

### No AI Response
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify the Azure OpenAI model deployment is running
3. Ensure API key has proper permissions
